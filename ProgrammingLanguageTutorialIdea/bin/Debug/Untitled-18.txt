;Reminder: To find many instances where +ESI is required, run the completed sunset document through as a class

; Test normal classes (non-structs)
; Try accessing class item from class (myClass.myOtherClass.myItem)
; Test accessing classes/structs as local variables with getting and setting
; Try classes/structs as return types and bug test that a bit

; Undone: Some getting/setting (pushValue/processValue/chkName) from class functions might need checkups (maybe missing some: function,array,variables,classes)
; Make sure they all work when the addEsi flag is set

; Remember to remove setpheapvar once fixed from the main resource, and clean up remainder if anything is not supposed to be there
