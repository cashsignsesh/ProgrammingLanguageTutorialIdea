; Try accessing class item from class (myClass.myOtherClass.myItem)
; ^ Let this work as well: retn(other.arr[other.arr[4]])
; ^ In indexArray, in the parseMath delegate, add a check for class accessor maybe

; Undone: Some getting/setting (pushValue/processValue/chkName) from class functions might need checkups (maybe missing some: function,array,variables,classes)
; Make sure they all work when the addEsi flag is set
