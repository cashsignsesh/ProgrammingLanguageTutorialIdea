On the class memory block that is used to copy bytes from:
 - This is where all static variables and functions will be referenced and called respectively
 - Only one should be made per compilation, so if it already exists in a previous Parser, don't make a new one, instead reference the initial one
 - Pass down the 0x0040???? memory address down to each next Parser VIA COMPILER
 
 
Todo:

 - In static functions, only permit referencing of static/local variables
 - Query static instances from origin functions
 - Fix static numbers inside classes being treated as if they werent (not accessing the actual static mem addr)
