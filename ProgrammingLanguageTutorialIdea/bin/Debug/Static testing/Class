; TODO:: 

;  --> Add an alternative to each if(addEsiToLocalAddresses) { ... } for static functions
;  --> Add an alternative to each memAddress (use Parser#GetStaticInclusiveAdddress) and to each opcodes/memAddress reference (many should be eliminated by default due to the nature of static contexts)

; initialization for static variables (i.e public static int i becomes 100 does not initialize until new non-static class instance is created), add it to data section immediately, throw error if initialization value is not constant or a different static/constant variable. Include support for strings
